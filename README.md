# Presentations

I do many talks about various things.  I'm often asked to do the same talks
and I don't like to repeat myself -- or at least I like to give a consistent
message.  So, I store a few of those talks here (in the form of markdowns
and slides).

These slides should be pretty generic and contain only public information.
They are not a replacement for the official documentation and/or presentations
on the Internet.  But if I had to explain something to a local team or even
to a set of people in, say, a meetup, it's what I'll use and reuse.

The first one is about Kubernetes and conceptually building a Kubernetes cluster.
The purpose is to help people learn about what Kubernetes is from a conceptual
perspective.  The theory is once they have this knowledge, they can do more
reading and that reading will make a lot more sense.
